# Raspberry Pi Pico SDK for Nim

This library provides the library and build system necessary to write programs for RP2040 based devices (such as the Raspberry Pi Pico) in the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming language

The libary provides wrappers for the original [Raspberry Pi Pico
SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk). The following features are
currently implemented:

* Automatic project scaffolding using the `piconim` tool
* Standard library features such as GPIO, time, ADC, PWM and many more
* Rudimentary TinyUSB support: USB device, HID and CDC (serial port) classes

## Setup

**The following steps will install piconim and create a new project**

1. First, you will need to have the Nim compiler installed. If you don't already
have it, consider using [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim)

2. Since this is just a wrapper for the original
[pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk), you will need to install the C
library [dependencies](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk#quick-start-your-own-project)
(Step 1 in the quick start section)

3. From the terminal, run `nimble install https://github.com/EmbeddedNim/picostdlib`.

4. Run `piconim init <project-name>` to create a new project directory from a
template. This will create a new folder, so make sure you are in the parent folder.
You can also provide the following options to the subcommand:
    - (--sdk, -s) -> specify the path to a locally installed `pico-sdk` repository,
    ex.  `--sdk:/home/casey/pico-sdk`
    - (--overwrite, -O) -> a flag to specify overwriting an exisiting directory
    with the `<project-name>` already created. Be careful with this.
    ex. `piconim myProject --overwrite` will replace a folder named `myProject`

## Building

Now you can work on your project. When you are ready to build the `.uf2` file
(which will be copied to the Raspberry Pi Pico), you can use the `build` subcommand:

`piconim build <main-program>`

Where `<main-program>` is the main module in your `src` folder. (ex. `piconim
build myProject` if the main nim file is `myProject.nim`). You can also specify
an output directory, otherwise it will be placed in `csource/build`

### `piconim setup`

If a piconim project is cloned fresh, or if `git clean` is ran, then the `csource/build`
directory will need to be re-generated by CMake. This can be accomplished with the
`piconim setup` command. The `setup` command takes an optional `--sdk` argument that works
exactly like for the `init` command, described above.

Examples:

```bash
# Run these commands from the project root.

# Re-run CMake, download Pico SDK from Github
piconim setup

# Re-run CMake, use existing SDK
piconim setup --sdk:/home/casey/pico-sdk
```
