  ##
  ## This method can be used to implement a lower power polling loop waiting on
  ## some condition signalled by an event (__sev()).
  ##
  ## This is called \a best_effort because under certain circumstances (notably the default timer pool
  ## being disabled or full) the best effort is simply to return immediately without a __wfe, thus turning the calling
  ## code into a busy wait.
  ##
  ## Example usage:
  ## ```c
  ## bool my_function_with_timeout_us(uint64_t timeout_us) {
  ##     absolute_time_t timeout_time = make_timeout_time_us(timeout_us);
  ##     do {

  ##         // we are waiting on has happened

  ##             return true;
  ##         }
